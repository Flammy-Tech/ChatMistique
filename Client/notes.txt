Overall Summary:
This JavaScript code sets up a real-time communication application using Agora RTM and WebRTC. It initializes the application, handles messaging, manages media streams, and includes functionality for video/audio toggling and WebRTC communication. The code is organized into functions for better modularity and readability.





. handleMessageFromPeer:
javascript
Copy code
let handleMessageFromPeer = async (message, MemberId) => {
    message = JSON.parse(message.text);

    if (message.type === 'offer') {
        createAnswer(MemberId, message.offer);
    }

    if (message.type === 'answer') {
        addAnswer(message.answer);
    }

    if (message.type === 'candidate') {
        if (peerConnection) {
            peerConnection.addIceCandidate(message.candidate);
        }
    }
}
This function handles messages received from another peer.
It parses the JSON-formatted message.
Depending on the message type, it performs different actions:
If the message is an "offer," it triggers the createAnswer function.
If the message is an "answer," it triggers the addAnswer function.
If the message is a "candidate," it adds the ICE candidate to the peer connection.
2. handleChannelMessage:
javascript
Copy code
let handleChannelMessage = (message, memberId) => {
    appendMessage(memberId, message.text, 'received-message');
}
This function handles messages received from the Agora RTM channel.
It extracts the text from the message and invokes the appendMessage function.
In the context of your application, it appends the received message to the chat UI.
3. handleUserJoined:
javascript
Copy code
let handleUserJoined = async (MemberId) => {
    console.log('A new user joined the channel:', MemberId);
    createOffer(MemberId);
}
This function is triggered when a new user joins the Agora RTM channel.
It logs a message indicating that a new user joined.
It then triggers the createOffer function, which is responsible for initiating the WebRTC offer.
4. createPeerConnection:
javascript
Copy code
let createPeerConnection = async (MemberId) => {
    peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection(servers);

    // ... existing code ...
}
This function creates a new WebRTC peer connection.
It sets up the peer connection, adds tracks (local media stream), and defines event handlers.
The function is called when a new user joins the channel (handleUserJoined) and when creating offers/answers.
5. createOffer:
javascript
Copy code
let createOffer = async (MemberId) => {
    await createPeerConnection(MemberId);

    let offer = await peerConnection.createOffer();
    await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(offer);

    client.sendMessageToPeer({ text: JSON.stringify({ 'type': 'offer', 'offer': offer }) }, MemberId);
}
This function is responsible for creating and sending a WebRTC offer to another peer.
It first creates a peer connection using createPeerConnection.
Then, it generates an offer, sets it as the local description, and sends the offer to the other user.
6. createAnswer:
javascript
Copy code
let createAnswer = async (MemberId, offer) => {
    await createPeerConnection(MemberId);

    await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(offer);

    let answer = await peerConnection.createAnswer();
    await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(answer);

    client.sendMessageToPeer({ text: JSON.stringify({ 'type': 'answer', 'answer': answer }) }, MemberId);
}
This function is responsible for creating and sending a WebRTC answer to another peer.
It first creates a peer connection using createPeerConnection.
Then, it sets the remote description based on the received offer, generates an answer, sets it as the local description, and sends the answer to the other user.
7. addAnswer:
javascript
Copy code
let addAnswer = async (answer) => {
    if (!peerConnection.currentRemoteDescription) {
        peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(answer);
    }
}
This function adds the received WebRTC answer to the peer connection's remote description.
It checks whether a remote description is already set before adding the answer.
8. leaveChannel:
javascript
Copy code
let leaveChannel = async () => {
    await channel.leave();
    await client.logout();
}
This function is called when leaving the Agora RTM channel or logging out.
It leaves the channel using channel.leave() and logs out the RTM client using client.logout().
These functions collectively manage the WebRTC communication and messaging logic within your application. They handle the creation and exchange of offers and answers between peers, manage ICE candidates, and handle messages received from the Agora RTM channel. The leaveChannel function ensures a clean exit when leaving the channel.
